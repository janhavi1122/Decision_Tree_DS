# Decision_Tree_DS
The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised machine learning method used for classification and regression. It splits data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree structure. It is easy to interpret but prone to overfitting, often mitigated by pruning or ensemble methods like Random Forest.

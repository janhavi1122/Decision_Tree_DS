This code creates a Decision Tree Classifier to predict if a person earns more than 100k based on features such as their company, job role, and degree. The dataset is loaded, and the target variable (salary_more_than_100k) is separated from the input features (company, job, and degree). Label encoding is applied to convert categorical features into numerical format, resulting in company_n, job_n, and degree_n. These encoded features are then used to train the Decision Tree model. The model is tested with example inputs to predict whether a given personâ€™s salary is likely to exceed 100k.

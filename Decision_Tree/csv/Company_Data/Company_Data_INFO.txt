This project uses a Decision Tree model to analyze company data and predict sales outcomes based on features like income, price, urban status, age, and advertising. After loading the dataset, initial data exploration includes visualizations like scatter plots and heatmaps to understand feature correlations and identify outliers. Categorical features are encoded, and the data is split for model training and testing. The Decision Tree Regressor model first predicts education levels based on population, while the Decision Tree Classifier model further categorizes encoded features for sales prediction. This approach helps analyze key business factors impacting sales and provides insights for potential business strategies.

This code builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict credit risk based on customer information like education, marital status, and urban location. It processes the data by encoding categorical features, trains the model on a training set, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed with visualizations like histograms and scatterplots to understand data distributions. Feature importance is also assessed to highlight the most influential factors in predicting credit risk. The goal is to enhance decision-making in loan approvals and reduce financial risk.

This code preprocesses a tumor dataset by handling missing values, visualizing feature distributions, and addressing outliers using Winsorization. It also applies log transformation to skewed features and standardizes the data using StandardScaler. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and an AdaBoost classifier is trained on the data. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score to predict tumor categories effectively.

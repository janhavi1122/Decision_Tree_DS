This project develops a Decision Tree model to analyze HR data, predicting employee attributes based on key features such as income, position, and years of experience. It begins with data cleaning, removing null values, and renaming columns for clarity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted with visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to understand feature distributions and identify potential outliers. Categorical data is then encoded for model compatibility, and the data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. The final model uses entropy as the splitting criterion, achieving insights into employee attributes and prediction accuracy.

This code builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict credit risk, based on customer attributes like checking_balance, credit_history, and employment_duration. After loading the dataset, it preprocesses the data by removing null values, dropping irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical variables into binary format. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training data using the entropy criterion to identify the best splits. Finally, predictions are made on the test set, with the modelâ€™s accuracy and confusion matrix used to evaluate performance. This helps in identifying customers at risk of default.

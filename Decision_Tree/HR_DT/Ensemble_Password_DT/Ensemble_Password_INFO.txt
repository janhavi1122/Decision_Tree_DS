This code processes a tumor dataset by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing values, visualizing relationships, and addressing outliers using Winsorization. It applies log transformation to skewed features, standardizes the dataset using StandardScaler, and then splits the data into training and testing sets. An AdaBoost classifier is trained on the data, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix. The overall goal is to predict tumor classifications based on the features in the dataset.
